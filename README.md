# Movie Prediction Using Pre-Production Factors
## Central Questions and Goals
This project centered around the discernment of the factors leading to a film's commercial success. Could these factors be determined prior to production, and if so, to what extent? What are relatively important and unimportant factors? To what extent can they be used in combination to explain the varience in box office of different films? My goal was to answer these questions and come up with new ones as I worked through this project and began exploring my data.
## Data & Cleaning
This project began with the [MovieTweetings](https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings) dataset, as it helped me with a few of my early challenges. First, as this project was primarily concerned with the commercial success of movies, experimental and highly niche projects were of limited interest to me. MovieTweetings allowed me to pre-filter for some of these factors, thus preventing me from having to query too many projects that were unrelated to my central questions. Second, MovieTweetings could provide an exciting avenue of future exploration for this project, allowing me to investigate what factors lead to continued interest and success after release.

After my initial filtering, I used the IMDB film ids to query [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
