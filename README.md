# Movie Prediction Using Pre-Production Factors
## Central Questions and Goals
This project centered around the discernment of the factors leading to a film's commercial success. Could these factors be determined prior to production, and if so, to what extent? What are relatively important and unimportant factors? To what extent can they be used in combination to explain the varience in box office of different films? My goal was to explore these questions and come up with new ones as I worked through this project and began exploring my data.
