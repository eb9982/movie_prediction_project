# Movie Prediction Using Pre-Production Factors
## Central Questions and Goals
This project centered around the discernment of the factors leading to a film's commercial success. Could these factors be determined prior to production, and if so, to what extent? What are relatively important and unimportant factors? To what extent can they be used in combination to explain the varience in box office of different films? My goal was to answer these questions and come up with new ones as I worked through this project and began exploring my data.
## Data & Cleaning
This project began with the [MovieTweetings](https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings) dataset, as it helped me with a few of my early challenges. First, as this project was primarily concerned with the commercial success of movies, experimental and highly niche projects were of limited interest to me. MovieTweetings allowed me to pre-filter for some of these factors, thus preventing me from having to query too many projects that were unrelated to my central questions. Second, MovieTweetings could provide an exciting avenue of future exploration for this project, allowing me to investigate what factors lead to continued interest and success after release.

After my initial filtering, I used the IMDB film ids to query [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) where I obtained several fields relating to movie characteristics including plot summary, actors, directors, writers, as well as box office information. I obtained additional data from IMDB lists so I could create collections of movies with certain characteristics, such as films based on prior media. As I would be predicting movie grosses across years, I performed an inflation adjustment on the domestic gross using Consumer Price Index data from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/9). After obtaining the data I had to perform a number of transformations to make it usable, which can be seen below(please note that while I did have data that would be post-production or post-release, I only used it for my own analysis and it was not used as a feature for prediction).
